## 🚀 About Me

I’m a data-driven technologist with a foundation in **software engineering** and a passion for **machine learning, causal inference**, and **AI-driven decision systems**.  

After starting my career at **Mphasis** developing scalable, user-centric applications, I transitioned into **data science and AI** to work on problems that connect analytical insight with real-world impact.

- 🔬 Currently working on my dissertation: *“Modelling Energy Efficiency and Policy Impacts in UK Housing”*  
- 🧠 Exploring **LLM-powered multi-agent systems** and **RAG architectures** in side projects  
- ⚙️ Interested in **AI for sustainability**, **big-data analytics**, and **intelligent automation**
